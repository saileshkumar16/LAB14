## Date : 2 November 2023
## Aim : Queue Implementation
## Algorithm : 

Initialization:
Before using a queue, you need to initialize it. This involves creating an empty queue and setting up pointers or variables to keep track of the front and rear.
Enqueue (Insertion):
Enqueue operation adds an element to the end of the queue (rear). It involves creating a new node with the given element and updating the rear pointer.
Dequeue (Deletion):
Dequeue operation removes the element from the front of the queue. It involves removing the node at the front and updating the front pointer.
Front (Peek):
Front operation retrieves the element at the front of the queue without removing it.
IsEmpty:
IsEmpty operation checks if the queue is empty.
